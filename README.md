# 📦 Fetch and Display Data from a Public API

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to **fetch and display user data** from a public API using JavaScript’s modern **Fetch API**.  
The API used is:https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

This free API provides dummy JSON user data, making it perfect for learning and testing API integration.

The project covers:
- API requests with `fetch()`
- JSON parsing
- Dynamic DOM manipulation
- Error handling
- Loading spinner UI
- Responsive and attractive design

---

## 🎯 Features
✅ Fetches data asynchronously using `async/await`  
✅ Displays **Name**, **Email**, and **Address** in styled cards  
✅ Attractive responsive grid layout using CSS  
✅ Loading spinner while data is being fetched  
✅ Error message display for network failures  
✅ Reload button to re-fetch data without refreshing the page

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** → Page structure  
- **CSS3** → Styling and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** → Fetch API, DOM manipulation, async operations
